There are very few things in this world that match up to the joy of reading. To be able lose oneself in the magical world of woven words & get transported to any destination in the universe, while sitting in the cozy comfort of your home or perhaps your favourite coffee joint, is rejuvenating to more senses than one. And in the age of internet and e-books, only true bibliophiles would understand the romance of reading from an actual paperback or a hardcover. The smell of books, using your lovable bookmarks to keep a check of where you're at, or even gifting someone a book with a special note - all these are things that no Kindle can match up to. An actual book doesn't even have a battery to drain, so you can read all day long! And what better time than summer break to catch up on all the titles that you have been meaning to?
