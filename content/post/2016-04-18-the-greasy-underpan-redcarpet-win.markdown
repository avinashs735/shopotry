Bryan Menell wrote  very interesting article on Techcrunch today titled “[The Greasy Underpan Of Restaurant Tech][greasy-underpan-of-restaurant-tech]”. Bryan takes a look at individual problems that startups are trying to solve in the restaurant space and explain why the large value proposition is not there.

We completely agree ! Now, that might seem surprising from someone who is playing in exactly the same field, but we believe a large number of startups are fighting the wrong battle.

Let’s look at the individual problems that are tricky to solve from a **value standpoint** - POS integration (value to POS vendors ?), Ordering (value to end customers?), Payments (value to restaurants?) and Loyalty (value to restaurants vs customers simultaneously) . Bryan hits the nail on its head when he points out that solving these pain points individually is of no use.

But let’s put it together - POS integration + loyalty + payments. 

Value to POS vendors - a cut on transaction sales happening through their POS. This could be a big revenue channel for the largest vendors out there.

Value to restaurants - payments by itself is not sexy, but when you combine payments with the ability to **seamlessly** integrate bank funded discounts, lean time discounts and cashbacks… what the restaurants gain is new customers. For customers, the value is bloody simple - <span>**you dont compete against a debit card… you compete against the cashier**</span> (who invariably does not know which discount to apply, whether you are eligible for a discount, does your credit card entitle you to cash back)

Value to customers - painfree applications of discounts and ability to earn rewards for loyalty. customers want an easy mechanism of discovery, payment (**with benefits already applied seamlessly**) and repeat incentives.

Value to customers + restaurants simultaneously - Loyalty is the big problem here. How do you generate a non-dilutionary behavior amongst rewards for merchants (which means a non-coalition, standalone loyalty), yet not have customers disappointed at lots of individual points at individual locations ? Well, you build a **P2P Rewards Marketplace** - you now enable customers to exchange the rewards that they dont want for rewards that they want… and for merchants, it is as good as a free new customer !

We at RedCarpet believe disruption in this space will happen through a seamlessly integrated process and a product that customers will love. Solving payments by itself isnt good enough (P.S. Read [Mobile Payments is a twist on identity rather than transactions][mobile-payment])
