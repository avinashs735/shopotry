A student’s life can be a complete mess sometimes - submitting assignments on time, attending lectures, keeping track of all class notes, all the extra-curricular activities and what not! Too much to do and too little time. So while, you all must be familiar with top grossing social media apps, we bring you this comprehensive list of the must-have apps that will make your life, a little bit easier.

Missed some class notes? Want to scan some documents? The first app on this lets you take images from your phone and then converts it into a scanned copy. Say goodbye to those scanners and save yourself a decent amount of time.

This is an app to put an end to your boredom. This app lets you stream all the highest grossing TV series, shows and latest movies. The fun part – It’s absolutely free! All you need is Wi-Fi or Data.

Want to keep up with all that is goings on across the globe but don’t have time to read a newspaper or watch a news channel? Inshorts to the rescue!
