Almost everyone dates during their college years and a college romance is something that is cherished throughout one’s life. But, dating in college might be catastrophic to your pocket. Being a student, one of the biggest cons of dating is the tight budget which you’ve to make do with. But having limited funds doesn't mean that you can't sweep your date off their feet. With a little preparation and planning, you can astound your sweetheart with memories that they’ll cherish forever.

If you’re hoping to save yourself some pennies while still impressing the ladies (and men) out there, here are some pro-saving dating tips for you all:

**Go on dates that cost next to nothing**                                                    
If you’re on a low budget or trying to save money, coming up with inexpensive date ideas is the key. Having a dinner and movie night in, going to see a local band at a free event, or even going for a hike are fun and cheap.

**Subscribe to social deals and discounts newsletter.**                                                     
Be it Dineout or Grabon, subscribe to every such apps as they regularly provide you with all the deals and discounts going on around your locality. If you’re lucky enough, you may even get up to 50% off on fancy restaurants and pubs.

**Get There Early**                                                  
The old adage, “The Early Bird Gets the Worm” holds true for dating on a budget. Whether you're thinking about seeing a movie with your bae or are hoping to go the hottest new club, early admission is always going to be cheaper.

**Happy Hours!**                                                                          
One of the most expensive parts of dating is eating out or going out for drinks. A few drinks at a bar or restaurant can burn a hole in your pocket. If you want to save yourself some cash, you may want to go for a mid-week date instead of weekends. Why? Well, because there are loads of happy hour deals you can grab during the weekdays that are not available during weekend.

**Go Dutch**                                                                       
Why should boys always pay? This is the era of feminism! It is best if you two split the bill. As an act of chivalry it’s always mandatory for a guy to pay for the first date. But after that it’s completely normal to make your Boo share expenses, and there isn’t any shame in doing so.

**Take up hobbies together**                                                            
Be it volunteering at an animal shelter, or enrolling in a dance class or even picking up a sport together - doing an activity together ensures weekly quality time together, while you invest in something productive as well. It’s a great way to bond and discover different facets of each other.

**Hit the outdoors**                                                                       
This is definitely an economic option and can be truly romantic if you do it right. A romantic stroll complemented with a perfect weather, walking down the avenue, holding hands under the moonlight will make a flawless date. Or go out on a picnic - take a rug, some card games and homemade sandwiches or other snacks, maybe a book - for a perfect day out. 

These are just a few things that’ll help you. Everything else depends on how you make your partner feel. The important thing is to think about what they enjoy, not what you feel like doing. Putting your date's interests before yours is the ultimate romantic gesture, and it never goes unnoticed!
