This one took us a while to put up but is one of the most interesting interviews yet with one of our interns. Our first video intern Monu Kumar is an engineer turned cinematographer and video editor. Self-taught and passionate, he brought in the right amount of enthusiasm and talent to the table while executing a project. Quiet on the outside, this chat with Monu reveals, just how deceptive looks can be.  Read more about his experience in this entertaining conversation.

**REDCARPET: Hey Monu! It was great to have you here intern with us. To start with, can you please tell us a bit about yourself and what are your career goals?**<br>
MONU: 'Yourself' is a pronoun used to refer to the person being addressed as the object of a verb or preposition when they are also the subject of the clause. LOL. Jokes aside,  I'm a person who is in love with potatoes since birth. I'd like to be a cinematographer one day apart from harvesting my own potatoes and eating them. I also love cashews by the way but believe me buying them is much easier because I've tried harvesting it. üòå It will take a lot of time to get those out. I don't lie about cashews. Promise.

**RC: Considering you are studying to be an engineer who worked with us in marketing communications, making videos, tell me how did you come about making this choice?**<br>
MONU: There are too many engineers and not enough jobs. So, I'm saving a job for someone else by making a different choice. See, how altruistic I am! üòá

**RC: From where did you get to know about RedCarpet and what made you want to intern here?**<br>
MONU: I came to know about RedCarpet from Internshala.com. I was coming to Delhi anyway, so I thought why not make use of the vacation and intern. Plus, the stipend.ü§ë

**RC: How exactly did you land this internship? What was the process?**<br>
MONU: I applied for the internship through Internshala.com and then after a series of emails with Sandeep Srinivasa, I was offered this Internship.

**RC: What kind of projects did you get to work on here? Was it the kind of work that you wanted to do?**<br>
MONU: My projects were to shoot videos and to edit them. The videos explained different aspects of Redcarpet like how the app works, documentation, internships, programs etc. We also worked on some creative videos. 

**RC: What would say was the most beneficial part of this internship - your most important takeaway?**<br>
MONU: As a film editor, I would say I got more acquainted with editing softwares like Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects. Now I'm confident enough to edit the videos the way I want.

**RC: And what was the most challenging thing that you had to do?**<br>
MONU: Well, I wasn't shooting in a media company so the challenges one had to overcome were the availability of proper equipment and a crew.

**RC: How did you like the work atmosphere at RedCarpet?**<br>
MONU: The work atmosphere in RedCarpet is really cool. You're not time bounded to enter and exit the office. Work comes before punctuality. Also, the office celebrations come with great food. And by food, I mean pizza and who doesn't love pizza? Don't you like pizza?  I mean seriously, ask yourselfüçï.

**RC: Surely there must be a few favourite moments here, can you share them with us?**<br>
MONU: Well, I had my first beer at a RedCarpet party, so I guess that counts as a great memory. If not, then me being vainglorious and Treesha, my manager, making faces like what-is-this-guy-made-up-of are my favorite moments.üôÜ

**RC: Now that your internship is over, what are you looking forward to next in the future?**<br>
MONU: I am looking forward to finishing my graduation first. I have 2 more years to go. 
Looking further than that is tough when I can't even look at the keyboard right now. Electricity is gone and I don't have a backlit keyboard.üòµ
