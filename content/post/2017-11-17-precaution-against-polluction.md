Delhi has been undercover a thick blanket of smog for the last few weeks and there are no signs, whatsoever, that the problem will be rid off, soon. The situation is so grave that healthcare agencies have declared the air in the city unfit for living - Delhi is currently the most polluted city in the world. 

In such a situation it becomes very important that you take measures to safeguard yourself from the hazardous environmental effects on your body. Please do not take this lightly. Here are a few precautionary measures that you must adopt to minimise the effects of pollution.                                         

  **RESTRICT OUTDOOR ACTIVITY**                           
    Avoid outdoors as much as you can. Even for walks or jogs, and irrespective of the fact that it is early morning or evening. When you exercise your breathing increases which will result in greater inhaling of pollutants.                                    

  **COVER YOURSELF**                                 
    Make it a point to wear a mask every time you go out - invest in a good quality N95 mask. It’s for your own lungs. Cover your eyes with glasses if possible.                             

  **HYDRATE A LOT**                                                
    Make sure that your intake of water is at its optimum, even though the weather might make you feel otherwise. Water helps cleansing the toxins in our body.                                

  **AVOID JUNK FOOD**                                                       
    Oily and fatty foods can create additional stress in your body when already dealing with the smog, and is best avoided.                                                

  **EAT RIGHT**                                                       
    Make sure to include a lot of vitamin-C rich foods in your diet. Include fruits like lemon, melon, grape, papaya and kiwis to fight smog related air-borne toxins. Include plenty of vegetables like peas, okra, cauliflower, cabbage, red bell peppers and broccoli in your daily diet.                        

  **AIR PURIFIERS**                                                         
    While the current situation is so bad that the masks and air-purifiers are also not completely effective, it is still a good idea to invest in one if you can, as it clears the air indoors as much as it can.                                    
  **FIGHTER PLANTS**                                                  
    There are some plants like Aloe Vera, Fikus, Ivy, Spider plant, Snake plants, and Peace Lilies that are natural air-purifiers and oxygen bombs. Keeping them inside and can contribute to fighting pollution indoors.           

  **DON’T BE A CONTRIBUTOR**                                                       
    Every contribution matters. Make sure yours is a positive one. Use public transport, encourage car-pool, avoid firecrackers in the upcoming wedding and festive season, refrain from indulging in bonfires (winter maybe coming, but still) and avoid smoking.                                         

    Even after taking all the precautionary measures against pollution if you feel any discomfort - ranging from breathing issues or irritation in skin and eye, it is best to consult a doctor sooner rather than later.
