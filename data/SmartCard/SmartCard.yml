answersix: Unlike market rate of interest, we neither charge hefty 3.5℅ monthly interest nor compound it monthly. We like to keep it simple- <b>Just 2℅ monthly simple intreset</b>. If the transaction amount is paid within 45 days , then the amount you pay is absolutely interest free, or else you can convert your payment into flexible EMI's on which 2% interest will be applied.
questionseven: What if I default (Don't pay you back)?
answerseven: Redcarpetup uploads the CIBIL score of every user. If the user pays their EMI on time their CIBIL score will improve. CIBIL score determines the credit worthiness of borrower. Banks consider CIBIL score before giving away any loan, also, in many foreign countries, CIBIL score is widely used to check the credibility of a user.
