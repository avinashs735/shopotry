      - text: Say you sell 15 cards a week, at the rate of ₹300 a card.
        image: Card-Sell.jpg
      - text: Payout for this sale is number of cards sold &#215; half cost price, <br>i.e. 15 &#215; 150 = ₹2250
        image: Card-Sell-2.jpg
      - text: Now bonus for 10 cards is ₹1000 and bonus for selling 5 cards is ₹300
        image: Card-Sell-3.jpg
      - text: If you are the highest seller in the week you also get ₹3000.
        image: Card-Sell-4.jpg
      - text: Total weekly payout = Bonus for selling cards (₹1300) + Weekly payout (₹2,250) + Weekly prize (₹3000) = ₹6,550
        image: Card-Sell-5.jpg
      - text: Which means total monthly payout will be<br> ₹ (6550 &#215; 4) + 5000 = ₹31,200
        image: Card-Sell-6.jpg
      - text: To reach the final destination you need to sell 500 cards, which according to the above estimate will take 8months.
        image: Card-Sell-7.jpg
      - text: This means if card sales are consistently done, in 8 months your total payout will be<br> ₹ (31,200 &#215; 8) = ₹2.5 lakh (approx.)
        image: Card-Sell-8.jpg
      - text: Add to this the value of the gifts you receive at the 3 milestones. Sell 100 cards = 1st milestone = get a Fitbit worth ₹12,000
        image: Card-Sell-9.jpg
      - text: Sell 250 cards = 2nd milestone = get an iwatch worth ₹25,000
        image: Card-Sell-10.jpg
      - text: Sell 500 cards = 3rd milestone - get an <span style="font-weight:bold;">iPhone</span> worth ₹60,000
        image: Card-Sell-11.jpg
      - text: Total earning = total payout + 1st milestone + 2nd milestone + 3rd milestone = 3.5lakh!
