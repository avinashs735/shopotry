But no bank gives small personal loan or credits to students. Now thanks to RedCarpet Creditpay Card, I'm truly independent

And every 2-3 months, there comes a big-bang sale on e-commerce websites or malls Landing me in trouble with my necessary monthly expenditures. But now with RedCarpet, I can easily buy anything I want and pay in EMIs without disturbing my budget.
