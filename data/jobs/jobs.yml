        - content: You will come into office fresh in the morning and grab a cup of coffee. We discourage coming into office late, and working till midnight. We only work late during crunch releases. We consider it a failure if we have to work weekends… but we do not complain if we have to get that critical release out. We realize that Google and Tesla was never built by 9 to 5 ers. We never check Facebook or Instagram in office - we would rather put in solid hours of work and go for a Crossfit session in the evening, than waste time and work till midnight. We encourage you to put your head down and [take a nap when you want].Snoring is discouraged.

We want people who are fearless and hungry.On the technology front, you’ll be working with our data science stack, our mobile apps as well as our web services. You will be unafraid to rewrite the entire python code because cProfile showed list comprehension is slowing down a batch operation on a machine with 256 mb RAM. You will inspect bytecode to realize that “BUILD_LIST” is being called way too many times.

          description: "The best, world-class data science teams are built with two kinds of people working together - the theoretical data scientist and the data science engineers+architects. While the “scientists” ponder all day and come up with interesting algorithms.. the data architecture team is the one that can translate (or fight) this algorithm into a world-class, production architecture. The way we think about the data engineering team is that you must look up to Doug Cutting who is the creator of Hadoop and Lucene.. two of the biggest and most transformative data science engines. Doug did not invent the “Map Reduce algorithm”, but certainly did as much for data science as any scientist did.
          Just like Designers and Engineers - both the data scientists and data engineers need to work together to build a world data science team.
          You must be the kind of engineer that will be a Doug Cutting at RedCarpet. Your job ? To transform the real-life impact of data science - which ends up being more important than dreaming of some algorithm."

          description: "Our Android stack is fairly exciting - we use a lot of reactive and functional programming with RxJava and Retrolambda. We are gradually adopting Kotlin (P.S. we are waiting for it to embrace RxJava completely). We constantly think of tradeoffs between power consumption responsiveness and clean code. We love experimenting with UX and responding to changes in customer behavior. We have grown 10X in the past three months and are continuing to grow as fast.We are looking at someone to come and be part of the senior team in the Android engineering effort. We have grown enough (and fast enough!) that we need someone better than us to build stuff the right way. You will pretty much be part of the founding engineering team and will get to redefine how a world class mobile fintech company gets built in India.You will be passionate about clean code and love writing testcases (yes - we believe that design for testing is the best way to design architecture). It doesnt matter if you dont know RxJava or any of this stuff … show us that you can learn fast enough.We dont care about years of experience - what we care about is what you can pull off !! Show us your Github.. it is the easiest way to have a conversation."

          We plan to build a stack that is scalable and builds on top of technologies like Kubernetes, PySpark, Luigi, AWS Lambda, Kafka, Gevent and Asyncio. We are looking for you to architect that.
          We were looking for someone to join us as our Technology Architect and join us on this incredible adventure.we’re looking for someone with a strong architectural and hacker background and willing to stand their ground and fight for what they believe is best - but be able to be pleasant while dealing with people. An engineer in this role is expected to design, build, deploy, and manage systems from scratch. You will wear multiple hats of “architect”,  ”tester” or “debugger” … everyone is expected to build systems from scratch.   This means that you will need to learn, ideate and innovate on various layers across the stack… and that comes with a tremendous amount of learning."
