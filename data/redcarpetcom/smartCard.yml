      answer: Redcarpetup uploads the CIBIL score of every user. If the user pays their EMI on time their CIBIL score will improve. CIBIL score determines the credit worthiness of borrower. Banks consider CIBIL score before giving away any loan, also, in many foreign countries, CIBIL score is widely used to check the credibility of a user.
