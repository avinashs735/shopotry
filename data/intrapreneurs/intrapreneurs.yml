  blueSubHeading: "You’re the One If You’re"
  Intrapreneurs: "A country is as independent as its Students. India is home to 6 Crore+ College Students living outside their homes. Being dominated by conservative society, students are not encouraged to be financially independent. Unlike in developed economies, Indian Students don’t have Credit Profiles. They don’t have easy access to funds for their new ideas, projects, wishes etc. With the advent of technology, globalisation & startups,students will be a significant contributor to the economic change.
      <br><br> 6 crores students spending ₹6k/month on average amounts to ₹432,000 crores annually & 70℅ of this has been through cash given by parents. This creates a barrier for the inclusion of whole student community in India's financial ecosystem."
  ButtonJointhejourney: Come Join the Journey

  Empowering: "We are very well aware that Empowering 6 Crores Students financially and enabling them with financial knowledge is neither a simple task nor can be achieved by one single organisation. The war for Financial Empowerment of Students can be won only if the soldiers are Students themselves.
      <br><br> This mission needs a ground soldier in every college, every classroom of india. You, the brightest of all, the most endeavouring of all, are going to be the one making this dream come true. You’ll be the empowered one among thousands and you will empower thousands!!
