Our office is about 100 meters from Sultanpur Metro Station (on the side that is **towards Gurgaon**)

### FROM SULTANPUR METRO STATION:

1. Exit the metro station (on the side that is **towards Gurgaon**) and walk straight.   

2. Take the second left lane. This will be right next to a lighting/illumination mall called **CRC Plaza** and **Centrum Mall**. This is right opposite Metro Pillar **PP16-17**

3. Walk straight for about 25 meters - you will see a small temple on your right. Right opposite the temple is a big blue steel gate. You will also see **Indian Bank** office inside these gates. There is also **Nappa Dori** studios next to Indian Bank

4. Walk inside this gate - our office is in the same complex. Its the very last building as you follow the path. Its above an office called HeadStart.

### DRIVING

If you are driving from Gurgaon, take a U-turn right under Sultanpur metro station (just 10 meters before you hit the metro station). This u-turn is bang next to a car store called **Big Boyz Toyz**. After you take the u-turn, drive straight for 25 meters (skip the first left lane).
You will see **CRC Plaza** and **Centrum Mall** and a left lane there (this is right opposite metro pillar **PP16-17**). We suggest parking on the main MG Road right next to the mall. Walk inside the lane using the same directions as mentioned above
