        Now with RedCarpet you can replace your old, outdated or broken electronic devices and buy a
        swanking new one. That too without burning a hole in your wallet!

        Just sell your old device, use the money you get from selling it as a downpayment for your new
        device and RedCarpet will pay the difference. Pay us back in easy EMIs. Itâ€™s that simple.
